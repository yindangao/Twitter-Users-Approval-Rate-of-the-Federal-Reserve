# Twitter-Users-Approval-Rate-of-the-Federal-Reserve
Hello world!

Two graphs related to the project have been uploaded to the repository. 

Graph 1 shows how the approval rate has been moving since 2012. By scraping and analyzing 2 million tweets related to the Federal Reserve posted in the past 7 years, we find the public's confidence in the Fed has been constantly changing. Roughly speaking, the continuing drop in the years before 2015 coincided with the tapering of quantitative easing. The rise between 2015 and 2018 came at a time when the Fed tried to bring monetary policy back to the normal track. And the turning point at the beginning of 2018 coincided well with the ending of Yellen's four year term. The yellow uncertainty band illustrates how controversial the Fed's policy has been, with wider uncertainty band  related with more divided public opinions. 

Graph 2 illustrates how each Fed monetary policy meeting was received by the public.
